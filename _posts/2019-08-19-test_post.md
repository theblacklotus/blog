title:  "The Tech Behind Eon: Tooling!"
author: Andreas Fredriksson (dep/TBL)

Eon represents four years of work and during this we made several iterations to
various tools and pipelines. I'll save the 3D scene packer and track loader for
separate posts, but this post will cover the other aspects of our pipeline.

## Code Builds

First things first: we use cross-compilation. Our build environment works on
Mac, Linux and Windows and produces both ADF floppy images and stand-alone test
programs, as well as a multitude of host tools. This section will cover some of
the details of our setup, as well as some history.

We started with a stripped down, assembly-only version of our A1200 demo system
(called NewAge for some reason). We got rid of all the C code and simplified
things down to the very basics. This is how early prototyping of things like
the rubber cube started, in plain 68k assembly.
