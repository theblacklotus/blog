        <title>The Tech Behind Eon: Tooling!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Eon represents four years of work and during this we made several iterations to
various tools and pipelines. Iâ€™ll save the 3D scene packer and track loader for
separate posts, but this post will cover the other aspects of our pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-builds&quot;&gt;Code Builds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first: we use cross-compilation. Our build environment works on
Mac, Linux and Windows and produces both ADF floppy images and stand-alone test
programs, as well as a multitude of host tools. This section will cover some of
the details of our setup, as well as some history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with a stripped down, assembly-only version of our A1200 demo system
(called NewAge for some reason). We got rid of all the C code and simplified
things down to the very basics. This is how early prototyping of things like
the rubber cube started, in plain 68k assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;welcome&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
